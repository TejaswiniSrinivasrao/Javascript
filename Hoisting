What is let, var and const? Explain hoisting? what is TDZ? explain with an example?
What is global scope, local and block scope?

1. Javascript follows lexical scoping
Let keyword is introduced in ES6(ES2015) and has block scope;
Var keyword is having functional scope;
const keyword is having block scope;

Example:
----------

function start(){
  for(var i=0; i<5; i++){
  if(true){
    var color = 'red';
    }
  }
  console.log(color); // output is red because the keyword var is having functional scope and is accesbile throughout the function
  }
  start();
  
  using Let Keyword:
  ------------------
  function start(){
  for(var i=0; i<5; i++){
  if(true){
    let color = 'red';
    }
  }
  console.log(color); // output is reference error:color is not defined because 
  //the keyword let is having block scope and is accesbile within the block here it is if block
  }
  start();

Global Variables:
-----------------

Var: when we use var outside the function it creates a global variable and attaches the varaible to the window object
 
Hoisting:
---------
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

    console.log (greeter);
    var greeter = "say hello"
    
    this is interpreted as follows:
    -------------------------------
    var greeter;
    console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
    greeter = "say hello"
    
let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, 
the let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.

const:
-------
const cannot be updated or re-declared
This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope.

    const greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable. 
    
    const greeting = "say Hi";
    const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared.   

differences between var,let and const:
--------------------------------------

var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; 
const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
